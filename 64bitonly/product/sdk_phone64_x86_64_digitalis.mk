# sdk_phone64_x86_64 with ARM64 translated (Digitalis)

# Ship a Digitalis-specific emulator config.ini with a larger data partition
# (80G vs the inherited 10G) so prebuilt ARM64 APKs — which are large and expand
# on install, plus asset-heavy games like Genshin Impact (~60-80G of post-install
# resource downloads) — fit without passing -partition-size at launch. This must
# precede the inherit below: PRODUCT_COPY_FILES dedups by destination keeping
# the first entry, so this wins over phone.mk's config.ini.nexus5.

# Default the GLES driver to ANGLE (the libEGL_angle / libGLESv1_CM_angle /
# libGLESv2_angle drivers already shipped by generic.mk) instead of gfxstream's
# GLES emulation. ANGLE implements OpenGL ES on top of Vulkan, so GLES calls are
# translated to Vulkan in-guest and only Vulkan crosses to the host via the
# gfxstream VkDecoder. This gives full GLES 3.2 (which ANGLE exposes) and better
# multisample/MSAA behaviour without patching gfxstream's GLES path.
#
# Android's EGL loader selects the driver by the ro.hardware.egl suffix
# (libEGL_<suffix>.so); for "angle" it loads libEGL_angle.so from /system/lib64.
# init.ranchu.rc sets ro.hardware.egl from ${ro.boot.hardwareegl:-emulation}, so
# it would otherwise default to gfxstream emulation. Setting ro.hardware.egl here
# lands it in build.prop, which second-stage init loads before `on early-init`
# runs; ro.* properties are write-once, so this value wins over init's later
# setprop regardless of whether the emulator supplies androidboot.hardwareegl.
# Scoped to the digitalis product so other goldfish images are unaffected.

# Advertise OpenGL ES 3.2 (0x00030002) to the framework to match the version the
# ANGLE driver now exposes (init.ranchu.rc enables ANGLE's
# exposeNonConformantExtensionsAndVersions). init.ranchu.rc sets ro.opengles.version
# from the emulator's ro.boot.opengles.version (3.1), but ro.* properties are
# write-once and build.prop is loaded first, so this value wins.
